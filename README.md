# Task Manager

## Description
The Task Manager project is a simple Java application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a centralized platform for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. The project consists of three main components: the `Main` class for user interaction, the `Task` class to represent individual tasks, and the `TaskManager` class to handle task operations.

## Key Features
- **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, due date, and priority level.
- **Task Listing:** Displays a list of all tasks with details such as title, due date, and priority.
- **Task Editing:** Allows users to modify existing tasks, including updating the title, description, due date, or priority.
- **Task Removal:** Provides functionality to delete tasks based on their title or other unique identifiers.
- **User Interaction:** Supports a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, allowing users to input commands to perform various operations.

## Technologies and Skills
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Strong understanding of OOP principles for designing classes and organizing code.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Knowledge of handling user input/output in a CLI environment.
- **Data Structures:** Understanding of data structures such as lists or arrays to store and manipulate tasks.
- **Exception Handling:** Skill in handling exceptions for error management and graceful application behavior.
- **Date and Time Handling:** Ability to work with date and time data for task due dates.
- **Version Control:** Proficiency in using Git for version control and collaboration.
- **Software Design Patterns:** Familiarity with design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, or Observer for maintaining clean and scalable code.
- **Testing:** Knowledge of unit testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit) for testing individual components and ensuring code reliability.
- **Documentation:** Ability to write clear and concise documentation for code, classes, and methods.
